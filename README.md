# Car-Sales-Prediction
The Car Sales Prediction Project aims to develop a machine learning model that forecasts car sales based on various influencing factors, including vehicle specifications that drive consumer purchasing decisions.

Project Overview
The Car Sales Prediction Project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts car sales based on various features such as vehicle specifications, market trends, and historical sales data. This project leverages data-driven insights to help car manufacturers, dealerships, and marketing teams optimize inventory management, enhance pricing strategies, and improve sales forecasting.

Objectives
Predictive Modeling: To create a robust regression model that forecasts the number of car sales for given parameters.

Data Analysis: To analyze historical car sales data to uncover trends and factors influencing sales performance.

Feature Engineering: To identify and create important features that can enhance the predictive capability of the model.

Market Insights: To provide insights into market dynamics and customer preferences based on sales patterns.

Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values and outliers.
Encoding categorical variables.
Normalizing numerical features to ensure consistent scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizing sales trends over time.
Identifying correlations between features and sales.

Modeling:
Experimenting with multiple regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to identify the best-performing model.
Splitting data into training and testing sets to validate model performance.

Evaluation:
Using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared to assess model accuracy.
Performing cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.

Expected Outcomes
A predictive model capable of accurately forecasting car sales based on the input features.
Visualizations of key insights derived from the data analysis (e.g., sales trends, feature importance).

Conclusion
This project not only aims to provide accurate sales predictions but also serves as a valuable tool for strategic decision-making in the competitive car sales market. By leveraging data science techniques, stakeholders can better understand consumer behavior and market dynamics, leading to more effective and informed business strategies.
